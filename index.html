      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Most founders at your stage run into the same roadblocks:
      </p>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Endless debate about <strong>what to build next</strong></li>
        <li>A product team that works hard but ships at an <strong>uneven pace</strong></li>
        <li>Features that go live, but <strong>don’t move the needle</strong></li>
        <li>Investors asking about traction while you wrestle with priorities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It’s not that your team isn’t capable. It’s that the <strong>system has bottlenecks</strong></p>
      <p>These hidden constraints are slowing down your growth.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section" id="solution">
      <h2>The Solution: Remove Bottlenecks, Create Momentum</h2>
      <p>I’ve seen it across 100+ startups.</p>
      <p> The moment a team uncovers the hidden constraints in their product process, everything changes.</p>
      <p> Decisions get sharper, priorities align, and shipping becomes consistent.</p>
      <ul class="arrows">
        <li>Instead of debating what to build, the path forward becomes clear.</li>
        <li>Instead of shipping in fits and starts, the team finds a steady rhythm.</li>
        <li>Instead of features fizzling out, they start building toward traction.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In practice, we improve your <strong>product operating model</strong> to help your team focus on what matters,
        cut out the noise, and deliver value at a steady pace.
      </p>
      <p>Once we remove the right bottlenecks, you deliver the right product at the right pace.</p>
      <p>Then your traction compounds.</p>

    <section class="section" id="why">
      <h2>Why me?</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve mentored <strong>100+ startups</strong> at <strong>Techstars</strong> and with top investors,
        and built products at companies that scaled to millions of users and were acquired by
        <strong>Forbes, Viacom, and Row</strong>. From <strong>AI investing (Q.ai)</strong> to
        <strong>streaming (Pluto.tv)</strong> to <strong>social platforms (Plug.dj, Open.me)</strong> and
        <strong>on-demand teams (A.Team, backed by Tiger Global)</strong>, I’ve seen what it takes for startups to break through.
