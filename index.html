      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <ul class="bullets">
        <li>Endless debate about <strong>what to build next</strong></li>
        <li>A product team that works hard but ships at an <strong>uneven pace</strong></li>
        <li>Features that go live, but <strong>donâ€™t move the needle</strong></li>
        <li>Investors asking about traction while you wrestle with priorities</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Itâ€™s not that your team isnâ€™t capable. Itâ€™s that the <strong>system has bottlenecks</strong> â€”
        hidden constraints slowing down your path to Product-Market Fit.
      </p>

    <section class="section" id="solution">
      <h2>The Solution: Remove Bottlenecks, Create Momentum</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve seen it across 100+ startups: the moment a team uncovers the hidden constraints in their
        product process, everything changes. Decisions get sharper, priorities align, and shipping becomes consistent.
      </p>
      <ul class="arrows">
        <li>Instead of debating what to build, the path forward becomes clear.</li>
        <li>Instead of shipping in fits and starts, the team finds a steady rhythm.</li>
        <li>Instead of features fizzling out, they start building toward real traction.</li>
        <li>Instead of misalignment draining leadership energy, communication becomes simple and the team rallies behind a shared plan.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In practice, this means improving your <strong>product operating model</strong> â€” a way of working that keeps your team focused on what matters,
        cuts out the noise, and delivers value at a steady pace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the right bottlenecks are removed, you start delivering the right product at the right pace.
        Thatâ€™s when traction compounds.
